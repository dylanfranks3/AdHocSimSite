# Usage
As described on the [Home page](/), using this tool, one can:
- Create (Ad-Hoc) networks with great customizability
- Create generated network traffic and generated topologies for networks
- Create a visualisation of these networks under simulation using manim and/or graph the simulation post execution

The tool comes with two CLI tools, one for creating traffic and one for runing the simulation

Before customizing the codebase, it's best to understand the structure of the library. See section [Structure](structure.html) for guidence.
